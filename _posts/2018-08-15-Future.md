We're back. Or are we? Give a warm HCMR welcome to our guest hosts! For a deeper dive on some of the references in this week's episode: The neurologist who makes the case against free-will is Dr. Sapolsky, and he is interviewed in the Radiolab episode, "Revisiting the Fault Line." The WaPo has an article on Caster Semenya and IAAF's new rules on who gets to race.

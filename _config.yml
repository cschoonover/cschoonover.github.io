  subtitle: Producing replacement-level basketball podcasts since 2014.
  summary: >
    Half-Cort and Mid-Raynge is for and sometimes by Joel Sherman. It was originally conceived as a way for Joel to have some entertainment as he ran the Boston Marathon in 2014. Since then, we’ve been tearing up the airwaves, bringing levity and/or philosophical pessimism to all of the newsiest NBA news.

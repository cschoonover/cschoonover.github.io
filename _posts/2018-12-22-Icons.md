Ray's back in town! This particular episode is so spicy that it defies description. We would just like to use this space to wish all of our listeners a happy end of 2018 and many Auld Lang Synes in the New Year. It's hard to believe that we recorded over 500 episodes of Half-Cort and Mid-Raynge in 2018, and I'd like to thank you all for listening to every one of them.
